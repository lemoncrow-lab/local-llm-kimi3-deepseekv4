     * other ring slot while the current layer computes. That is worth roughly 16 s/token
     * at the measured 6.4 GB/s, against about 3 s of arithmetic per layer, so it would
     * hide almost entirely. It is deliberately NOT written yet: it introduces a
     * concurrent writer to the slot the kernels are reading, and that is a race worth
     * paying for with a test rather than guessing at. */

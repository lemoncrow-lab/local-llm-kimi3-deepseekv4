/* k3_trunk.h - stream the resident trunk, so RAM becomes a dial instead of a floor.
 * Modified 2026-08: optional persistent metadata supports an experimental CUDA Q4
 * trunk cache. That modified path accepts the quality trade-off discussed below; the
 * exact path continues to stream the checkpoint's BF16 bytes.
 *
 * WHY STREAM THE TRUNK AT ALL
 *   The engine holds 110 GB of trunk plus 4.70 GB of embed/lm_head. That is the floor
 *   that forces a 128 GB machine. Quantising it down is the obvious idea and it is the
 *   wrong one: Kimi K3's technical report section 4.1.4 says the experts are MXFP4 with
 *   quantisation-aware training "while all non-expert components (attention projections,
 *   latent MoE projections, shared experts, and MoE routers) remain in higher
 *   precision". That list IS this trunk. Measured on 31 real attention tensors
 *   (docs/data/trunk-quantisation.txt), post-hoc int4 costs 17.4% mean relative WEIGHT
 *   reconstruction error against 0.96% for int8 -- an ~18x gap, consistent across every
 *   tensor sampled. That is weight error, not output quality, but it is enough to rule
 *   out 4-bit on a trunk that was never trained for it.
 *
 *   Streaming costs zero error. The bytes are the checkpoint's own bytes.
 *
 * WHY IT IS AFFORDABLE
 *   Read bandwidth decides this, and it varies by an order of magnitude between a
 *   network volume and local NVMe. Measure the target device with tools/devbw.py
 *   before drawing conclusions. On local NVMe at a few GB/s the whole trunk costs
 *   tens of seconds per token against compute of the same order, so the read is not
 *   automatically the bottleneck. What makes it hideable is that, unlike expert routing,
 *   the trunk access order is FIXED: layer 0, 1, ... 92, every single token, so the next
 *   read is always known in advance.
 *
 *   NOTE it is not currently hidden. k3_trunk_prefetch is a no-op on the O_DIRECT path
 *   (POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED warms the page cache, which O_DIRECT exists to bypass), so the
 *   read does not overlap the previous layer's arithmetic today. Doing so needs real
 *   async I/O; the fixed order is what would make it straightforward.
 *
 * WHY LRU WOULD BE THE WORST POSSIBLE POLICY HERE
 *   A cyclic sequential scan is the classic LRU pathology. With N < 93 slots, by the
 *   time the walk returns to layer 0 it is exactly the least recently used thing and has
 *   just been evicted, so the hit rate is ZERO no matter how much RAM is added. This
 *   cache therefore PINS a prefix of layers and streams the rest through a small ring:
 *   pin K layers and the hit rate is exactly K/93, deterministically, and every extra
 *   gigabyte buys its fair share. The expert cache keeps LRU because expert reuse is
 *   data-dependent, which is the opposite situation.
 *
 * LAYOUT
 *   tools/pack_trunk.py copies each layer's trunk, which is ONE contiguous run in its
 *   shard, into trunk.bin, and records offsets in trunk.json. So loading a layer is a
 *   single pread from local NVMe. The bytes are copied verbatim, so a tensor's position
 *   inside a slot is (its absolute shard offset - the run start).
